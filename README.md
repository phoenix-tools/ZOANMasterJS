# Note to readers re:CryptoZoons

This project, along with BladeMasterJS, taught me a lot of about the nature of ponzi schemes. I do not recommend investing time or money into CryptoZoon, and for that, I can't recommend putting any of your time into installing this add-on JS extension. But I had a lot of fun building it. And I'm proud of the work.

A JS class that enhances the https://app.cryptozoon.io/ UX experience while offering an edge in battle. 

ZOANMasterJS is open source, but access to the API requires a `.01` BNB tip to the development team every 40 days.  

You can still download and install this asset and enjoy a 14 day free trial without having to tip any BNB. The trial is tied to your MetaMask wallet address.


## Features

* Prominently displays the USD market prices of BNB, ZOON, and YAG
* Prominently displays the current user's ZOON/YAG balance as well as its converted values in USD and BNB
* Prominently displays the current user's BNB balance as well as its converted values in USD 
* Shows ZOAN profitability performance as well as averaged performance statistics across the 24 hour, 7 day, ans 31 day time ranges.

## How to Install in Chrome

Install a Chrome extension that will allow custom JS & CSS codefor websites. I recommend this extension but if anyone knows better ones I'm happy to add them to the list:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld?hl=en

Access this file and view the raw version of the code:
https://github.com/phoenix-tools/ZOANMasterJS/blob/master/ZOANMasterJS.js

Navigate to https://app.cryptozoon.io/

Open the newly installed Chrome Extension's Custom CSS and JS extension

And click "add new" to create a new custom JS/CSS profile for the CrytoZoon website

Add the raw code that was copied earlier into the JavaScript panel, and save the profile.

And that's it! The next time you access https://app.cryptozoon.io/ the JavaScript code should be loaded and ZOANMasterJS operating. 

If you have any trouble installing please reach out to @atwellpub the Discord and I'll help asap.

Happy Zooning!
