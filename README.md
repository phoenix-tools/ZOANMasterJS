A JS class that enhances the https://app.cryptozoon.io/ UX experience while offering an edge in battle. 

ZOANMasterJS is open source, but access to the API requires a `.01` BNB tip to the development team every 40 days.  

You can still download and install this asset and enjoy a 14 day free trial without having to tip any BNB. The trial is tied to your MetaMask wallet address.


## Features

* Prominently displays the USD market prices of BNB and ZOON
* Prominently displays the current user's ZOON balance as well as its converted values in USD and BNB
* Prominently displays the current user's BNB balance as well as its converted values in USD and ZOON
* Shows user BNB fee expenditure for the CrytoZoon game in the following ranges: 24 hours, 7 days, 31 days.
* Provides fight tracking statistics that keeps track of win percentage, ZOON Payouts, BNB expenditures, and overall profits based on current market prices.

## How to Install in Chrome

Install a Chrome extension that will allow custom JS & CSS codefor websites. I recommend this extension but if anyone knows better ones I'm happy to add them to the list:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld?hl=en

Access this file and view the raw version of the code:
https://github.com/phoenix-tools/ZOANMasterJS/blob/master/ZOANMasterJS.js

Navigate to https://app.cryptozoon.io/

Open the newly installed Chrome Extension's Custom CSS and JS extension

And click "add new" to create a new custom JS/CSS profile for the CrytoZoon website

Add the raw code that was copied earlier into the JavaScript panel, and save the profile.
